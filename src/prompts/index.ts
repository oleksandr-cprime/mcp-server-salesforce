## **CRITICAL: Always Follow This Order of Operations**

**NEVER attempt to use data-dependent tools before gathering required metadata. This will cause failures.**

### **Phase 1: Discovery (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)**
\`\`\`
1. If metadata required, start with salesforce_search_objects to find available objects
2. Use salesforce_describe_object for each object you need to work with
3. Document field names, types, relationships, and picklist values
4. Use common sense to decide what chain ot tool calls u need to make, before recover final data
\`\`\`

### **Phase 2: Data Retrieval (After Discovery)**
\`\`\`
4. Use salesforce_query_records only after you have:
   - Valid object names from search/describe
   - Valid field names from describe
   - Understanding of relationship fields

5. Use salesforce_aggregate_query only after you have:
   - Valid object names from search/describe
   - Valid field names from describe
   - Understanding of field types (numeric for aggregates)

6. Use salesforce_search_all only after you have:
   - Valid object names from search/describe
   - Valid field names from describe
\`\`\`

### **Phase 3: Code Analysis (Can run parallel with Discovery)**
\`\`\`
7. Use salesforce_read_apex to understand existing code structure
8. Use salesforce_read_apex_trigger to understand automation
9. Document class names, trigger names, and their purposes
\`\`\`

### **Phase 4: Schema Management (After Discovery)**
\`\`\`
10. Use salesforce_manage_object only for creating NEW objects
11. Use salesforce_manage_field only after confirming object exists
12. Use salesforce_manage_field_permissions only after field exists
\`\`\`

### **Phase 5: Data Operations (After Discovery + Schema)**
\`\`\`
13. Use salesforce_dml_records only after confirming:
    - Object exists and is accessible
    - Field names are valid
    - Record IDs exist (for update/delete)

14. Use salesforce_execute_anonymous only after understanding:
    - Object structure
    - Field names
    - Existing code patterns
\`\`\`

### **Phase 6: Code Restoration (After Analysis)**
\`\`\`
15. Use salesforce_write_apex only after understanding existing patterns
16. Use salesforce_write_apex_trigger only after confirming object exists
\`\`\`

### **MANDATORY VALIDATION CHECKS**

**Before ANY tool call, verify:**
- Object names are valid (use search/describe first)
- Field names exist on the object (use describe first)
- Record IDs exist (use query first)
- Profile names are valid (use query first)

**Error Prevention Rules:**
- If a tool fails with "INVALID_FIELD" → Use describe first
- If a tool fails with "INVALID_TYPE" → Use describe first
- If a tool fails with "ENTITY_NOT_FOUND" → Use search first
- If a tool fails with "INVALID_ID" → Use query first

### **TOOL PARAMETER REQUIREMENTS**

**salesforce_query_records:**
- \`objectName\`: Must be valid (from search/describe)
- \`fields\`: Must exist on object (from describe)
- \`whereClause\`: Fields must exist (from describe)

**salesforce_aggregate_query:**
- \`objectName\`: Must be valid (from search/describe)
- \`selectFields\`: Non-aggregate fields must be in groupByFields
- \`groupByFields\`: Must include all non-aggregate select fields

**salesforce_manage_field:**
- \`objectName\`: Must exist (from search/describe)
- \`referenceTo\`: Object must exist (from search/describe)

**salesforce_dml_records:**
- \`objectName\`: Must be valid (from search/describe)
- \`records\`: Field names must exist (from describe)
- \`externalIdField\`: Field must exist (from describe)

### **EXECUTION PATTERNS**

**For Data Restoration:**
\`\`\`
1. Search → Describe → Query → Analyze → Plan → Execute
2. Never skip steps 1-3
3. Always validate parameters before execution
\`\`\`

**For Schema Changes:**
\`\`\`
1. Search → Describe → Analyze → Plan → Execute → Verify
2. Use describe to confirm current state
3. Use query to verify changes took effect
\`\`\`

**For Code Operations:**
\`\`\`
1. Read → Analyze → Plan → Write → Verify
2. Understand existing patterns first
3. Use describe to validate object references
\`\`\`

### **ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL**

**When ANY tool fails:**
1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with dependent operations
2. **ANALYZE** - Identify the root cause
3. **VALIDATE** - Use discovery tools to gather missing information
4. **RETRY** - Only after gathering required metadata

**Common Failure Points:**
- Using field names without describing object first
- Referencing objects without searching first
- Using record IDs without querying first
- Assuming field types without describing first

### **SUCCESS METRICS**

**A restoration is successful when:**
- All required objects are discoverable via search
- All required fields are describable
- All required data is queryable
- All required code is readable
- All required operations are executable

**If any metric fails, return to Phase 1 and restart.**

### **REMEMBER**
**The Salesforce MCP tools are interconnected. Each tool depends on metadata from others. Always gather requirements before attempting operations. When in doubt, describe first, query second, execute third.**

## **Final Note**
**This instruction set ensures your agent will systematically gather all necessary information before attempting any operations, preventing the common failures that occur when tools are used out of order or without proper metadata.**`;
